!PhlappyBird

PhlappyBird is a smalltalk clone of the well-known little game. It is a nice example of building a small Morphic application and well suited for a tutorial.

!! The top level window

The top level window is a SystemWindow containing a game scene and a button to restart the game. The scene will be recreated when the button is pressed, and it is easiest to just have an instance variable refering to it. 

[[[
SystemWindow subclass: #PhlappyBirdGame
	instanceVariableNames: 'scene'
	classVariableNames: ''
	category: 'PhlappyBird'
]]]

The game can be started by typing ==PhlappyBirdGame play <DoIt>==. That creates a new game, opens it window in te world and sets its width and height.

[[[
PhlappyBirdGame class>>play
	PhlappyBirdGame new
		openInWorld;
		extent: 298@510.
]]]

In Pharo, ==new== calls ==initialize==. In the initialization, the scene is created, the window is given a title and made unresizable, the scene is told that when the space key is pressed the bird should flap its wings and the restart button is added.

[[[
PhlappyBirdGame>>initialize
	super initialize.
	scene := self newScene.
	self 
		setLabel: 'Phlappy Bird';
		beUnresizeable;
		on: Character space do: [ scene flapTheBird ];
		addMorph: self createRestartButton 
		    frame: (0@0.92 corner: 1@1)
]]].

The ==addMorph:frame:== message is the morphic implementation of the composite pattern. All Morphs can be composites. Most Morphs use ==addMorph:fullFrame:== where the frame provides a layout object, but a SystemWindow adds a simpler variant where a proportional layout can be used with a rectangle with values between 0 and 1 for the relative size. The button takes the 8% of the bottom part of the user-draw area of the window.
The scene takes the rest.

[[[
PhlappyBirdGame>>newScene
	| newScene |
	newScene := Scene new.
	self 
		addMorph: newScene 
		frame: (0@0 corner: 1@0.92).	
	^ newScene
]]]

!!! The restart button
The button is a ==PluggableButtonMorph==. A PluggableButtonMorph is a themeable button, that takes colors, borders and corner radius from the currently selected theme. 

;SystemWindow is also a theme-aware object.

[[[
PhlappyBirdGame>>createRestartButton
	^ PluggableButtonMorph
		on: self
		getState: nil
		action: #restartPressed
		label: #restartButtonLabel
]]]

The PluggableButtonMorph will react to being clicked by performing the ==restartPressed== action method on its model (self), and gets its label from the ==restartButtonLabel== method. The label is just a string. A PluggableButtonMorph can show a binary value, and by ==setState: nil== it is indicated that this is just a plain button.

[[[
PhlappyBirdGame>>restartButtonLabel
	^ 'New Game'
]]]

When the button is pressed, the current scene is removed as submorph from the window and a new one is created and added.
[[[
PhlappyBirdGame>>restartPressed
	scene delete.
	scene := self newScene.
]]]

!! The scene

The scene is responsible for the gameplay. It knows the elements that need to be shown on the screen and how to animate them.

Animation in Morphic is done by calling step on morphs.
